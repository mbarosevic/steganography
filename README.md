# Steganography

The art of hiding information in plain sight. Unlike encryption, where it's obvious that a message is being hidden, steganography hides data in plain view, inside a file such as a picture. As far as images are concerned, to anyone who isn't aware that it contains hidden data, it looks like just a normal, innocent picture.
